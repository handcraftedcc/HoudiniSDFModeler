# SDFModeler
 A free, open source SDF Modeling Toolset for Houdini

## Installation
1. Download and unpack zip file into folder of your choice.
2. Copy SDFM.json to houdini package folder
	```
	Windows: c:/Users/<yourusername>/Documents/houdini19.5
	OSX: ~/Library/Preferences/houdini/19.5
	Linux: ~/houdini19.5
	```
3. Replace ```"PATH/TO/PACKAGE/"``` with path to the folder. In my case that will read: ```"C:/Users/Dominik/Documents/Houdini Assets/Project Packs/SDFModeler"```
	Make sure to use "/" as seperators, not "\" otherwise it won't work.
